## Description 
This application was made for the purpose of creating persistent notes for a daily schedule. Via get, post, and delete functions users are able to modify the applicaitons JSON file to make objects. By using unique id's generated by uuidv4 each object contains a unique identifyer string. Using these unique identifyer strings the application is able to with the deltete button call a delete function that will get rid of finished or unwanted notes. 
## Installation
For this application to work you will need to install:
- uuidv4 use: npm i uuidv4
- express use: npm i express
